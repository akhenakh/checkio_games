""" You are given an expression with numbers, brackets and operators. 
For this task only the brackets matter. Brackets come in three flavors: "{}" "()" or "[]". 
Brackets are used to determine scope or to restrict some expression. If a bracket is open, 
then it must be closed with a closing bracket of the same type. The scope of a bracket must not 
intersected by another bracket. For this task, you should to make a decision to correct an expression 
or not based on the brackets. Do not worry about operators and operands.
Input: An expression with different of types brackets. A string (unicode).
Output: The correctness the expression or donâ€™t. A boolean."""
